      <p>
        This is a really basic react app created to learn how to implement
        various hooks that were introduced lately. I know it's really good and
        all but common who wants to re-learn the beautiful class methods but
        anywho it's really cool. Go on inspect this website using React dev
        tool, no redux was use but ofc I used to context hooks and oh my the
        freedom to play around with state variables in any component without
        having to write chains of props is immense.

    </div>
